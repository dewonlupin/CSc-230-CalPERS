Below are instructions for downloading and installing composer and swiftmailer.
I'm using XAMPP-VM on Mac. You may need to change the commands depending on operating system you use.

1. Install composer:

  sudo curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | /opt/lampp/bin/php

  sudo ln -s /opt/lampp/bin/php /usr/local/bin/php

  sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

2. Change directory to htdocs:

  cd /opt/lampp/htdocs

3. Install swiftmailer:

  sudo composer require "swiftmailer/swiftmailer:^6.0"
